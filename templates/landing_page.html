                  Importantly, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is of critical clinical importance since the rate of morbidity is very high and the surge in the number of cases has been constantly increasing, and earlier treatment <code>improves outcomes</code> as well as alleviating burden on the healthcare system. </p>

                    Automatic triage of imaging studies using computer algorithms has the potential to <code>detect COVID-19  earlier</code>, ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes. Such a quality improvement tool could be used to automatically manage the priority for interpretation of imaging studies with presumed COVID-19 and help 
                    <code>optimize radiology workflow.</code> Machine learning and computer vision are among a suite of techniques for teaching computers to learn and detect patterns.</p>

                    However, these solutions as well as those in the coming future are heavily dependent on the availability of data. 
                    We aim to extend our reach to individuals who may have relevant information about any patient including demographics, history, experiences, 
                    symptoms and medical documents. A <a href="/form">comprehensive set of fields</a> will enable us to gather fresh data and  observe new patterns. 
                    We hope that our efforts will contribute towards <code>improving exisiting technologies</code> or perhaps sow the seeds of the next big idea.
